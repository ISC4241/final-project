# Cluster 0 — “Moderately Engaged Long-Timers”

### Quantitative Profile

-   engagement_breadth: ~1.58 (narrow engagement)
-   tech_score: ~2.08 (light technical involvement)
-   social_score: ~0.14 (almost no social events)
-   events_attended_year: ~2.48
-   is_discord_active: 54%
-   member_days_since_join: ~303 (around one year in KH)

### Behavioral Interpretation

Cluster 0 consists of returning members who are not deeply engaged. They typically attend only a couple of events per year, usually technical ones. They rarely participate in GBMs or socials, maintain light Discord involvement, and have not fully integrated into the community.

### Dues Behavior Prediction

Medium-low dues conversion (10–25%).

-   is_discord_active: 70%
-   is_sponsor_hunter: 6%
-   member_days_since_join: 167 (newer members)

### Behavioral Interpretation

### Behavioral Interpretation

Cluster 2 represents the top 1–3 percent of members. These individuals attend events across nearly every category, are extremely active on Discord, and resemble organizers, ops team members, or future leadership. They are the most deeply embedded participants in Knight Hacks.

### Dues Behavior Prediction

Very high conversion (70–90%).

# Cluster 3 — “Social + Discord Regulars (Mid-Tier Core)”

### Quantitative Profile

### Dues Behavior Prediction

Medium-high conversion (35–55%).
